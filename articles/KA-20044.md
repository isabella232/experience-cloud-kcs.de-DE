# Das Ablaufdatum von Link freigeben ist in E-Mail anders

## Beschreibung


`For the share link functionality in Brand Portal (BP), the selected expiration date does not match the date in email notification.`




## Auflösung


`This is as designed. The date time displayed in email is server time while the time shown in browser (while doing link share) is the local time (i.e. time of system on which link share is being done).`

`For example if server time is UTC and I am doing link share on a system which has IST timezone then time which will be shown in email (example) 07/08/2022 3:02 PM and corresponding date/time which will be shown in browser 2022-08-07 20:32. Both these correspond to same time but the difference is that the time shown in email is in UTC while that shown in browser is local time IST.`
